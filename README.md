# A computerized facial approximation method for Homo sapiens based on facial soft tissue thickness depths and geometric morphometrics (JOA 2023)


## Introduction

This repository is built for the implementation of the paper "Facial approximation of a Late Pleistocene Human Fossil in the Yahuai Cave, southern China".



## Abstract
An almost complete human cranium, alongside a partial mandible dating to approximately 16,000 BP, was discovered in the Yahuai (YH) Cave in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, southern China. An estimation of facial appearance has captured the imagination of the academic community and the general public, potentially influencing perceptions of characteristics and evolutionary history of Homo sapiens. The aim of this research was to explore a computerized method integrating geometric morphometrics and three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics to: 1) examine the morphological variations of the YH skull in comparison to contemporary human skull morphology; 2) estimate 3D facial appearance using various facial soft tissue thickness depths and the facial morphology of contemporary humans; and 3) capture morphological variations in the approximated face to provide insights into the facial traits of the Late Pleistocene individual. The results indicate that the YH skull is relatively distinct from contemporary human skulls, and this is reflected in morphological dissimilarities in the approximated face. We discuss the methods involved in computerized facial approximation, which has the potential to contribute to estimating the facial appearances of other Late Pleistocene human skulls.
